# YarrL 0.2.0

A pirate-themed roguelike treasure hunt!

YarrL began as my entry for the March 2020 edition of the 7DRL Challenge. I had a lot of fun spending the week toiling away on a game, and my intention is to continue development of YarrL and at the version least turn it into something that I enjoy playing!

In YarrL, you play a scallwag who's got their grubby, greedy hands on a clue to a lost treasure and have sailed to the Yendorian Straits to track it down. You'll have to explore islands, follow a trail of hints, avoid dangerous wildlife and (if you are the author of the game) try not to crash your ship into rocks.

I have arbitrarily declared that YarrL reached version 0.2.0 at the end of 7DRL...
