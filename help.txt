YarrL 0.2,0 - a pirate roguelike

~Movement in YarrL~

When you are not steering your ship, movement (by default) is 
done via the classic vi/rogue-style keys:

             yu
             hjkl
             bn 

These correspond to the cardinal points:

           NW (y)  N (j) NE (u)
              \     |    /
         W (h)   -  @  -   E (l)
              /     |    \
           SW (n)  S (k) SE (m)
